# Calculator

A Calculator is a small electronic device to perform various arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, etc. It makes our calculations easier and faster. We use a scientific or sophisticated calculator in some situations, where we need to solve complex calculations.

## OBJECTIVES

The prime objective of the calculator is to perform a number of calculations in response to user supplied input. The possible number of calculations is pre-defined. The results of the calculations may be presented in summary or detailed format. It is these outputs that are the main business functions of the calculator.


## Features

This project is used by the following features:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Square

Square Root




## Research
The project will be a simple Scientific Calculator implementation in C. You will use various 
calculations to calculate different mathematical operations. The output of the project will be a 
console application without any graphics. You should implement at least following mathematical 
operations.
1. 2D Matrix operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Square & Squre root


2. Solution of non-linear polynomial equations [ 2nd order only, 3rd order opertion




4. Solution of simultaneous algebraic equations [2 and 3 variables only].

5. Complex number operations like, addition, subtraction, multiplication of two complex numbers, magnitude of a complex number.
## 4W & 1H
WHO - The calculator is a tool to do calculations just as the human mind and paper and pencil are tools.

What - A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, Division etc..

when - The calculator is a tool to do calculations just as the human mind and paper and pencil are tools. Â· It is very important to learn how to estimate the result.

where - A scientific calculator is the unique type that is designed to calculate problems in engineering and science. 

HOW - A scientific calculator has additional features that allow you to work with exponents and logs, which require more memory in order to perform functions for the best results.
